Password Generator

A Python-based application that generates secure and random passwords using randomization and loops. This project is designed to help users create strong passwords that enhance security for their online accounts.

Features

> Generates passwords of customizable lengths.

> Includes options for:

    > Uppercase letters

    > Lowercase letters

    > Numbers

    > Special characters

> Ensures randomness for maximum security.

> Simple and user-friendly command-line interface.


Technologies Used

> Python
    > random module: For randomizing character selection.
    > Loops: To iterate and construct passwords efficiently

    
How It Works

1. The user specifies the desired password length and types of characters to include.

2. The program uses the random module to select characters from specified pools (e.g., letters, numbers, special characters).

3. A loop assembles the password character by character, ensuring randomness.
